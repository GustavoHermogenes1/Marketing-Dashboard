**Marketing Dashboard in Power BI - Data Analysis**

In today's data-driven world, businesses handle a big amount of information, becoming crucial to transform raw data into importants insights. Thus, I developed a marketing dashboard in Power BI, using advanced data analysis techniques to improve the visualization of KPIs and optimize campaign performance.

To ensure an efficient and reliable data flow, I followed a structured process that included:

âœ… Data Modeling: I designed a better data structure, creating a relational model that improves analysis efficiency.

âœ… Data Cleaning and Transformation in Power Query: I standardized and transformed the data, ensuring consistency and deleting outliers that could compromise analysis quality.

âœ… Segmentation of the Original Dataset: I splited the original dataset into different tables, improving model performance and ensuring a more organized structure for analysis.

âœ… Creation of Measures in Power BI: I created metrics using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) to generate dynamic calculations and strategic insights, such as sales amount and conversion rates.

**My Analysis**

In the dashboard, we can see the customers profile, such as their age, salary distribution, spends by categories, education and marital status. According to these informations, I could realize that the most people have the following characteristics:

- Over than 41 years old
- Single
- Annual Income over 40k
- Graduated
- The people without teenager spend more

Looking into the campaigns performance, people who bought are similiar to the facts above. But, most of those who did not buy have one teenager at home. Therefore, It is importante to direct campaings according to these informations.

**Business Impact**

This dashboard enables faster and more data-driven decision-making, allowing marketing managers to identify trends, assess campaign performance, and adjust strategies based on accurate insights. Additionally, automating analyses reduces the time spent on manual spreadsheet manipulation, increasing team productivity and efficiency.

This project highlights the importance of Business Intelligence (BI) in marketing, helping companies become more data-driven and maximize their results. ðŸš€
